            <em>If someone sends you this link while asking a question, it implies that you should not...</em>
            <strong>MAKE JOKES ABOUT THEIR QUESTION</strong>
        </div>

        <h2>What defines "joking around" in this context?</h2>
        <p>Joking isn't just about telling jokes. In technical discussions, "joking around" includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bait-and-switch (Mock Seriousness):</strong> Deliberately creating a message that looks long and
                professional, but the content is actually misleading, harmful, or nonsense (e.g., recommending fake or
                malicious tools).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dismissive Sarcasm:</strong> Mocking the asker's idea as "delusional" or "useless," instead of
                explaining why it might not work. If they ask "How to do it," don't answer with "Why would you do that?"
                just to sound superior.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Spam:</strong> Sending memes, stickers, or GIFs that serve no purpose in explaining the
                issue.</li>
            <li><strong>Troll Links:</strong> Rick Rolls, Duckrolls, or any link leading to entertainment content meant
                to derail the conversation.</li>
            <li><em>... and any action that disrupts the train of thought of the person needing help.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Consequences?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lost in Translation:</strong> Not everyone shares your cultural context or humor style. A
                "friendly jab" can easily be misinterpreted as a personal insult.</li>
            <li><strong>Adding Fuel to the Fire:</strong> Unintentionally making the situation more tense, especially
                when the asker is highly stressed (e.g., facing a deadline or a production outage).</li>
            <li><strong>Signal-to-Noise Ratio Drop:</strong> You are diluting the thread. Serious answers get buried
                under memes, making it harder for others to help.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of Professionalism:</strong> Breaking the necessary focus, even in "casual" community
                spaces.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>"You must be fun at parties..." / "Why so serious?"</h2>
        <p>You might feel that asking for "no jokes" is an attack on your <strong>freedom of speech</strong> or your
            right to have fun.</p>
        <p>But consider this: If you have the freedom to joke, the asker also has the <strong>freedom to set a
                boundary</strong> for their own inquiry.</p>
        <p><i>Is that request unreasonable?</i><br />No. It is a <strong>reasonable boundary</strong>. They are here for
            a solution, not for entertainment.</p>
        <p>If this request annoys you, it’s likely a clash of <strong>communication styles</strong> rather than anyone
            being "wrong." In that case, the mature move is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quietly ignore the thread.</li>
            <li>Hide the message or block the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>... instead of forcing your humor onto someone who clearly hasn't consented to it.</p>

        <h2>Why do people send this link?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Burnout & Fatigue:</strong> They may have received too many unhelpful, vague, or "troll" answers
                in the past. They are just tired of filtering through the noise.</li>
            <li><strong>High Stakes:</strong> They might be in a situation where a mistake has serious real-world
                consequences, and they can't afford ambiguity.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Context:</strong> They might be from a culture where workplace/technical seriousness is
                the norm and "roasting" is considered disrespectful.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What if the question is unclear / lacks data / looks like a joke?</h2>
        <p>You should still answer politely! If you suspect it's a "low-effort" question, guide them on how to ask
            better.</p>
        <p>If you want to make fun of it, keep it to your private DMs or groups where the asker is not present. Publicly
            mocking a beginner is just <strong>gatekeeping</strong>.</p>

        <h2>On "Internet Culture" & Reading the Room</h2>
        <p>If you are used to <strong>Western internet culture</strong> (Reddit, Discord, etc.), sarcasm and irony might
            be your default language. But remember:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Internet is Global:</strong> What is a "sick burn" in one culture can be a "slap in the
                face" in another. In many Asian cultures, preserving "face" and hierarchy is crucial. Aggressive
                roasting is often seen as pure hostility, not bonding.</li>
            <li><strong>Context is King:</strong> Even if the asker shares your culture, <strong>stress kills
                    humor</strong>. When someone is panicking over a bug, your "funny" meme feels like you're laughing
                <em>at</em> their misfortune.</li>
        </ul>

        <p
            style="background-color: var(--accent-color); padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid var(--text-color); font-style: italic;">
            "Please don't forget: <strong>timing</strong> decides whether you are relieving stress, or if you are just
            being a jerk."
        </p>
        <p><strong>Respect the boundary.</strong> When someone explicitly asks for seriousness, it's not the time to
            show off your wit. It's time to show your professionalism.</p>

        <!-- NEW SECTION: SWEETSEA'S STORY -->
        <div class="personal-story">
            <h2>Why did I write this?</h2>
            <p>Since I was young, I've often been the victim of ill-timed jokes. Even when I was focused on work and in
                no mood to laugh, I was still poked and prodded. To them, it was "just a joke," but to me, it was pure
                exhaustion.</p>
            <p>Even within my own family, sarcastic remarks from relatives often silenced me. But in the name of
                so-called "family harmony," I was forced to smile and answer things I didn't want to.</p>
            <p>When going online, I just hoped to find a space to ask and answer decently. But instead, what I usually
                got were memes, malicious tools, brainrot videos, or irrelevant answers thrown straight in my face.</p>
            <p>No one had made this website yet, so I did. It's just that simple. What we need is **Signal**, not
                **Noise**. We need productivity and respect, not rude interruptions.</p>
            <p>That is the reason <a href="https://nohello.net" target="_blank">nohello.net</a> was born, and I am
                simply here to continue that legacy.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- NEW SECTION: HATER RESPONSE -->
        <div class="hater-response">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--danger-color);">"You have too much free time making this nonsense
                website..."</h3>
            <p>Thank you for worrying about my time. But I'd rather spend an afternoon making this website to save
                hundreds of hours of explanation later, than waste one more second reading your meaningless messages.
                Goodbye.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic;">And if you still wonder why I am so allergic to the phrase
                "it's just a joke," then look at this:</p>

            <div class="stamp-container">
                <img src="https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://storage.sekai.best/sekai-en-assets/stamp/stamp0052/stamp0052.png"
                    alt="Hoshino Ichika Stamp - Project SEKAI" class="stamp-img">
            </div>

            <p>Even a gentle soul like Hoshino Ichika, who loves her friends dearly, feels tired when life is a series
                of cruel jokes: Saki losing her youth to illness; Shiho isolating herself to protect her dreams; Honami
                being bullied for caring too much.</p>

            <p>If you were a classmate who dared to "joke" about her pain, do you think she would laugh? No. Ichika
                might just get angry, and she might even slap you with all her might.</p>

            <p>So don't blame the real human beings behind the screen — those who are silently struggling with invisible
                pressures — for not smiling at your "jokes."</p>
